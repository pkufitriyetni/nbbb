# Enhanced No Fog System - Multi-Area Support

## Overview
The Enhanced No Fog system fixes the issue where the No Fog feature only worked in the first area/map of "99 Nights in the Forest" and stopped working when players moved to areas 2, 3, and beyond.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Fog Detection
The system now scans and removes fog from multiple sources:
- **Global Lighting** - `Lighting.FogStart`, `Lighting.FogEnd`, `Lighting.FogColor`
- **Atmosphere Objects** - Found in models/folders throughout the workspace
- **Clouds Objects** - Weather-related fog effects
- **ParticleEmitters** - Fog/mist/haze particle effects
- **Area-specific Fog** - Fog folders/models that load per area
- **Terrain Effects** - Terrain-based fog and water effects
- **LocalTransparencyModifier** - Parts with fog-like transparency effects

### 2. Real-time Area Monitoring
Multiple monitoring systems ensure persistent fog removal:
- **Workspace Monitoring** - Detects new objects added when entering areas
- **Lighting Property Monitoring** - Prevents game scripts from overriding fog settings
- **Player Movement Tracking** - Detects area transitions automatically
- **RenderStepped Connection** - Continuous fog removal every frame

### 3. Intelligent Area Detection
Position-based area detection system:
```lua
Area1: X < 100, Z < 100          -- Starting area
Area2: X 100-500, Z < 100        -- Second area  
Area3: Z 100-500                 -- Third area
AreaOther: All other positions   -- Additional areas
```

### 4. Enhanced Fog Removal Process
When No Fog is enabled, the system:
1. **Stores Original Settings** - Backs up current fog values for restore
2. **Applies Global Fog Removal** - Sets lighting fog to invisible
3. **Scans Entire Workspace** - Removes fog from all objects
4. **Monitors Continuously** - Watches for area changes and new fog objects
5. **Reapplies on Area Change** - Automatically removes fog when entering new areas

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions

#### `scanAndRemoveFogFromWorkspace()`
Comprehensively scans all workspace descendants and removes fog effects:
- Atmosphere objects: Sets density to 0, removes color/decay effects
- Clouds objects: Disables and sets density to 0
- ParticleEmitters: Disables fog-named emitters
- Fog folders/models: Recursively removes fog from contained objects

#### `detectAreaChange()`
Monitors player position to detect area transitions:
- Uses position-based area boundaries
- Tracks last check time to prevent spam
- Returns true when area change detected
- Updates current area tracking

#### `applyNoFog()`
Main fog removal function with area support:
- Removes global lighting fog
- Calls workspace scanning
- Checks for area changes
- Reapplies fog removal if area changed

#### `toggleNoFog(enabled)`
Enhanced toggle function with multi-area support:
- **When Enabled:**
  - Stores original fog settings
  - Sets up multiple monitoring connections
  - Applies immediate fog removal
  - Starts continuous monitoring
- **When Disabled:**
  - Disconnects all monitoring
  - Restores original fog settings
  - Cleans up tracking variables

### Monitoring Connections

1. **Primary RenderStepped** - Continuous fog removal every frame
2. **Workspace DescendantAdded** - Monitors for new fog objects
3. **Lighting Property Signals** - Prevents game override of fog settings
4. **Player Movement Heartbeat** - Checks for area changes every 3 seconds

## Usage Instructions

### For Players
1. **Enable No Fog** - Toggle the "No Fog" button in the Visual tab
2. **Move Between Areas** - The system automatically detects area changes
3. **Enjoy Clear Vision** - Fog will be removed in all areas automatically
4. **Disable if Needed** - Toggle off to restore original fog settings

### For Developers
The enhanced system is fully integrated into the existing script. Key variables:

```lua
-- Enhanced No Fog Variables
local NoFogEnhanced = {
    processedFogObjects = {},      -- Tracks processed fog objects
    lastAreaCheck = 0,             -- Last area detection time
    currentPlayerArea = nil,       -- Current detected area
    fogMonitoringConnections = {}  -- All monitoring connections
}
```

## Benefits

### Before Enhancement
- ❌ Only worked in first area
- ❌ Stopped working when moving to new areas
- ❌ Limited fog source detection
- ❌ No area change monitoring
- ❌ Manual reactivation required

### After Enhancement
- ✅ Works in ALL areas automatically
- ✅ Detects area changes and reapplies
- ✅ Comprehensive fog source removal
- ✅ Real-time monitoring system
- ✅ Persistent across all game areas
- ✅ Enhanced debugging output
- ✅ Proper cleanup and restore

## Troubleshooting

### If No Fog Stops Working
1. Check console for area change messages
2. Toggle No Fog off and on again
3. Move to different position to trigger area detection
4. Look for "🗺️ Area change detected" messages

### For Script Developers
- Monitor console output for debugging information
- Area changes logged with "🗺️" prefix
- Fog reapplication logged with "🔄" prefix
- Use test script in `/tmp/test_nofog.lua` for validation

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal Performance Cost** - Optimized monitoring connections
- **Smart Area Detection** - Only checks every 3 seconds when moving
- **Efficient Fog Scanning** - Only scans when area changes detected
- **Proper Cleanup** - All connections properly disconnected when disabled

The Enhanced No Fog system ensures a consistently clear gaming experience across all areas of "99 Nights in the Forest"!
